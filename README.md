# DriverPass-System-Analysis-and-Design

#### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was DriverPass, a company that specialized in driver's education. This includes hands on training sessions with their certified instructors as well as test prep materials so students can pass their drivers test. They desired a web application that would allow their customers to purchase driving packages online. These packages provide students with driving sessions and in some cases, access to their practice tests and quizzes. This system would allow users to be easily added or removed from the system.  



#### What did you do particularly well?

I felt that I did a good job breaking down the system and its components. I was able to explain how each of the processes worked without delving too much into the technical jargon and managed to keep it simplified for nontechnical audiences. What I think really helped me break this down was the knowledge I had obtained from my Bachelor's in Business Administration. I have the business background as well as a technical background so I can look the system from two different perspectives: technical and nontechnical. This allows me to determine what aspects I needed to simplify while still getting the point across.

Another aspect I felt I did well on was the UML activity diagrams. I was able to break down the use cases into simple, easy to follow guides that contained all the relevant steps. I feel that the average person could look at these diagrams and understand what is going on with this use case. 


#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The system processes could have been explained more clearly

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I looked at what DriverPass wanted with their application and tried to find ways to incorporate these features into a logical system. I then determined who would most likely use these desired features and designed the system around that.I did however make some slight adjustments. For example, the owner of DriverPass wanted to be able to reset passwords and add/remove users from the system. I made sure the system would have this functionality but I also provided the IT department with this functionality as well. It made sense both from practicality and scaleability. The IT department would be most qualified to handle any technical issues. Also, as the application scaled, more people would be needed to perform this functionality. Having only one person able to reset passwords and add/remove users would be impractical. Other than these few adjustments the system design remained faithful to DriverPass's vision. 

#### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
